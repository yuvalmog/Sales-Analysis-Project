This project analyzes a simulated dataset of 1,000 sales records using Excel.
The data includes dates, regions, agents, payment methods, sales amounts, costs, commissions, and profits.
Dynamic data was generated with Excel functions (RANDBETWEEN, INDEX, VLOOKUP), then converted into static form for consistent analysis.
Pivot tables and charts were used to examine sales and profit by date, region, and agent, as well as the distribution of payment methods.
The analysis highlights seasonal demand patterns, top-performing agents, and profitability trends across different regions.
